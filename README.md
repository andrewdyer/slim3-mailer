Email support for the Slim Framework using Twig and 
[Swift Mailer](https://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer). Mailable classes will
massively  tidy up your controller methods or routes, and will make sending email 
a breeze.

## Installation

```bash
composer require andrewdyer/slim3-mailer
```

## Usage

Attach a new instance of `Anddye\Mailer\Mailer` to your applications container so 
it can be accessed anywhere you need. `Mailer` takes two arguements; an instance of 
`Slim\Views\Twig` and an optional array of SMTP settings.

```php
$app = new \Slim\App;
    
$container = $app->getContainer();
       
$container['mailer'] = function($container) {
    $twig = $container['view'];
    $mailer = new \Anddye\Mailer\Mailer($twig, [
        'host'      => '',  // SMTP Host
        'port'      => '',  // SMTP Port
        'username'  => '',  // SMTP Username
        'password'  => '',  // SMTP Password
        'protocol'  => ''   // SSL or TLS
    ]);
        
    // Set the details of the default sender
    $mailer->setDefaultFrom('no-reply@mail.com', 'Webmaster');
    
    return $mailer;
};
    
$app->run();
```

If your application doesn't use Twig views already, you will need to also attach 
this to your container.

```php
$container['view'] = function ($container) {
    $view = new \Slim\Views\Twig(__DIR__ . '/../resources/views');
    $basePath = rtrim(str_ireplace('index.php', '', $container['request']->getUri()->getBasePath()), '/');
    $view->addExtension(new \Slim\Views\TwigExtension($container['router'], $basePath));
    
    return $view;
};
``` 

### Supported Options

| Option | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| host | string | The host to connect to. |
| port | integer | The port to connect to. |
| username | string | The username to authenticate with. |
| password | string | The password to authenticate with. |
| protocol | string | The encryption method, either SSL or TLS. |

### Sending the Email (Basic Example)

```php
$app->get('/', function (Request $request, Response $response) use($container) {
    $user = new stdClass;
    $user->name = 'John Doe';
    $user->email = 'johndoe@mail.com';
    
    $container['mailer']->sendMessage('emails/welcome.html.twig', ['user' => $user], function($message) use($user) {
        $message->setTo($user->email, $user->name);
        $message->setSubject('Welcome to the Team!');
    });
    
    $response->getBody()->write('Mail sent!');
    
    return $response;
});
```
**welcome.html.twig**

```html
<h1>Hello {{ user.name }}</h1>
    
<p>Welcome to the Team!</p>
    
<p>Love, Admin</p>
```

### Sending with a Mailable

Using mailable classes are a lot more elegant than the basic usage example above. Building 
up the mail in a mailable class cleans up controllers and routes, making things look 
a more tidy and less cluttered as well as making things so much more manageable.

Mailable classes are required to extend the base `Anddye\Mailer\Mailable` class;

```php
use Anddye\Mailer\Mailable;

class WelcomeMailable extends Mailable
{
    
    protected $user;
    
    public function __construct($user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }
    
    public function build()
    {
        $this->setSubject('Welcome to the Team!');
        $this->setView('emails/welcome.html.twig', [
            'user' => $this->user
        ]);
        
        return $this;
    }
    
}
```

Now in your controller or route, you set the recipients address and name, passing 
just a single argument into the `sendMessage` method - a new instance of the mailable 
class;

```php
$app->get('/', function (Request $request, Response $response) use($container) {
    $user = new stdClass;
    $user->name = 'John Doe';
    $user->email = 'johndoe@mail.com';
    
    $container['mailer']->setTo($user->email, $user->name)->sendMessage(new WelcomeMailable($user));
     
    $response->getBody()->write('Mail sent!');
    
    return $response;
});
```
